standard measure for determining the class position of workers. However this class scheme does not deal adequately with the structural changes in the post-industrial economy. Esping-Andersen proposed a better-suited
alternative. This article elaborates on this and focuses on two elements.
Firstly, it presents a coding scheme for translating job-scores of the Dutch occupational classification (SBC-92) into scores of the Esping-Andersen scheme. Secondly, this scheme is applied to changes in the employment structure of the Netherlands and the two biggest cities in the Netherlands (Amsterdam and Rotterdam) between 1992 and 1996.
The article shows clearly the changing class structure of the Netherlands
and the differences between the two cities. More important, however, is that the class structure of both cities evolves different. In Amsterdam the class structure of the traditional industrial sector (???the Fordist hierarchy???) professionalised, while the class structure of the post-industrial sector (???the post-Fordist hierarchy???) polarised. In Rotterdam the opposite holds true. These findings are highly relevant for recent discussions in urban sociology, and illustrate the relevance of the class-scheme of Esping-Andersen. The older EGP-scheme would not showed these diverging trends. Therefore it is necessary to use a class-scheme that accounts for the structural job changes related to the emerging post-industrial society.</dc:description><dc:language>other</dc:language><dc:relation>BSK-CPM;BSK-CPM-2000-006</dc:relation><dc:subject>Social class</dc:subject><dc:subject>social Inequality</dc:subject><dc:subject>Inequality</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cities</dc:subject><dc:title>Een postindustriele klassenstructuur?

The article outlines some of the main strengths and weaknesses of both schools. After a discussion of recent Flemish studies of Hans de Witte, it is concluded that in theoretical and methodological perspective these Flemish studies are somewhere between the ?Dutch? and ?Rotterdam? school. It is then concluded that Dutch stratification research in general would benefit if both Dutch schools would more collaborate and learn from each other.</dc:description><dc:language>other</dc:language><dc:relation>BSK-CPM;BSK-CPM-1997-001</dc:relation><dc:subject>Social Stratification</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social Inequality</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social Class</dc:subject><dc:title>Ongelijkheid en klassen in Nederland en Belgi?.

Critique with respect to the EGP service class is related to criticism regarding `The Constant Flux' (Erikson &amp; Goldthorpe 1992). This work is mainly concerned with the classical theme of the shift from agriculture to industry and it neglects the important `post?industrial' distinction between the industrial and service sector. This criticism particularly applies to the `service class' as conceptualized by the EGP class scheme. It does not take important institutional changes in post-industrial society into account. Consequently, the life styles and beliefs of the 'service class' show a large amount of variation. We therefore propose to modify the EGP-class scheme by distinguishing the `social and cultural specialists' within the service class. Using the Dutch Family Survey (1992/93) we show that this adjustment of the EGP?class scheme is an improvement with respect to the explanation of a variety of attitudes and behaviour. The finding that our results hold after controlling for relevant predictors such as education, signifies the importance of our revision of the EGP-class scheme.</dc:description><dc:language>other</dc:language><dc:relation>BSK-CPM;BSK-CPM-1997-002</dc:relation><dc:subject>Social Stratification</dc:subject><dc:subject>Class Analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Social Class</dc:subject><dc:subject>Classification</dc:subject><dc:subject>Service Industries</dc:subject><dc:subject>Netherlands</dc:subject><dc:title>De 'service' klasse in Nederland: een voorstel tot aanpassing van de EGP-klassenindeling</dc:title><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/1006/BSK008.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

flexible and permanent workers. Following the well-known ?flexible-firm?
model van Atkinson and in accordance with segmentation theory, we can assume that flexible workers will have a worse labour market position compared to permanent workers. We have tested this assumption using two different indicators of the career of workers, respectively changes in the job level and chances to become unemployed. Our main conclusions are: 1) the job level of jobs held by flexible workers is somewhat lower compared to jobs held by permanent workers; 2) flexible workers have a somewhat higher chance to become unemployed compared to permanent workers; 3) there are large differences with respect to these two indicators between several categories of flexible workers. Overall, the empirical results give some support to the assumptions of segmentation theory. The rival ?waiting-room hypothesis? (which assumes that flexible workers will catch up an initial disadvantaged position) is not supported.</dc:description><dc:language>other</dc:language><dc:relation>BSK-CPM;BSK-CPM-1999-001</dc:relation><dc:subject>Flexibility</dc:subject><dc:subject>Workers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Labor Market</dc:subject><dc:title>De arbeidsmarktpositie van flexibele werknemers: bewijs van een gesegmenteerde arbeidsmarkt?</dc:title><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/1008/BSK009.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

This paper 
develops a simple model of strategic networks which captures two distinctive features of such 
collaboration activity: bilateral agreements and non-exclusive relationships. We study the 
effects of collaborations on individual R&amp;D effort, cost reduction, and market performance. 
We then examine the incentives of firms to form collaborative links and the architecture of 
strategically stable networks. Our analysis highlights the interaction between market 
competition and R&amp;D network structure. We find that if firms are Cournot competitors then 
individual R&amp;D effort is declining in the level of collaborative activity. However, cost 
reduction and social welfare are maximized under an intermediate level of collaboration. 
In some cases, firms can gain market power, and even induce exit of rival firms, by forming 
suitable collaboration agreements. Moreover, under certain circumstances, such asymmetric 
collaboration networks are also strategically stable. By contrast, if firms operate in 
independent markets then individual R&amp;D effort is increasing in the level of collaborative 
activity. Cost reduction and social welfare are maximized under the complete network, 
which is also strategically stable.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Econometric Institute Reports;EI 2000-26/A</dc:relation><dc:subject>Strategic alliances</dc:subject><dc:subject>Networks</dc:subject><dc:subject>Research and development</dc:subject><dc:title>R&amp;D Networks</dc:title><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dc:subject>D 21; D 43</dc:subject><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/1035/feweco20000921113742.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

contradictory theories, interpretations and empirical contradictions. Based on previous qualitative research in the Netherlands (1992), we have
contributed to this debate by introducing the internal differentiation
hypothesis. This paper addresses the empirical validity of this hypothesis
by analysing data from a representative Dutch panel of 1022 respondents in
paid employment. The data show a small overall net upgrading trend. However, automation seems to have different effects for various occupational groups.
For blue-collar workers, our findings suggest that a trend of internal
differentiation does exist. Next, we examine the consequences (for
underemployment and jobsatisfaction) of automation and changes in work
content. Although our outcomes do not support our internal differentiation
hypothesis, they do show the important effect of autonomy and complexity on feelings of underemployment. The outcomes justify Mottaz? statement that one of the consequences of this underemployment is job dissatisfaction.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>BSK-CPM;BSK-CPM-2000-004</dc:relation><dc:subject>Automation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Information Technology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Workers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Blue Collar Workers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Work Skills</dc:subject><dc:subject>Underemployment</dc:subject><dc:title>Automation, Job content, and Underemployment</dc:title><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/1175/BSK012.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

However, as a result of the rising costs of early retirement schemes, curbing the outflow of older workers from the labour force has become a central government policy objective. Early retirement reforms under which benefits are financed on a more actuarially neutral basis are currently being implemented in the Netherlands. At present it is not clear how older workers will react to these policy reforms. In this paper we examine the extent to which (Dutch) older workers are inclined to change their retirement intentions in response to new early retirement arrangements. On the basis of a labour market and a population survey we examine retirement intentions under alternative early retirement policies. The overall conclusion is that the retirement reform may lead to a substantial delay of the retirement date, but that in practice more forces than the financial incentives are at work. This is also reflected in the long-run early retirement trend. This trend presents demographers and economists with a puzzle because a break shows up in the time series but this break has set in before the actual early retirement reforms were put into practice.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>OCFEB Research Memoranda;RM 0202</dc:relation><dc:subject>Early retirement</dc:subject><dc:subject>Older workers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ageing</dc:subject><dc:subject>Labour market</dc:subject><dc:title>Early retirement reform: Can it work?

The behavior of the founder is then regarded as the behavior of the firm. Founder behavior with regard to strategy use can be studied by what they do (strategy content) and by how they do it (strategy process). This paper focuses on characteristics of the strategy process of individuals. The strategy process is operationalized by a behavioral measure of the manners in which small business founders deal with situations. A longitudinal analysis of 49 small business starters relating strategy use to firm performance suggests a dynamic process between strategy and performance. Business owners that perform poorly employ a Reactive Strategy, with poor performance leading to increased use of reactive behavior. High performing business owners start out focussing on the most crucial issues (Critical Point Strategy), with high performance leading to a more top-down (Complete Planning) approach. These relations are controlled for characteristics of the environment of the firm. Strategy use is dependent upon the type and level of environmental uncertainty. Complete Planning strategy is used less frequently in a fast changing environment and more often in a complex environment. Use of Opportunistic Strategy is negatively related to the complexity of the environment, while the Reactive Strategy is used more frequently in a non-munificent environment.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>OCFEB Research Memoranda;RM 9904</dc:relation><dc:subject>Strategy</dc:subject><dc:subject>Entrepreneurship</dc:subject><dc:subject>Uncertainty</dc:subject><dc:subject>Performance</dc:subject><dc:subject>Small business startups</dc:subject><dc:title>Strategies, uncertainty and performance of small business startups</dc:title><dc:type>Working Paper</dc:type><dc:subject>L20; M; M13</dc:subject><dc:subject>83.82</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kleinbedrijf; Prestatiebeoordeling; Ondernemerschap</dc:subject><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/1480/rm9904.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The impact of tax policy on labor market performance depends importantly on various other labor-market institutions, such as minimum wage laws, wage bargaining, and unemployment benefits. In non-competitive labor markets, employment declines if a higher tax burden makes the outside option (i.e. unemployment) relatively more attractive. Marginal tax rates typically differ substantially across individuals. To explore the impact of specific tax policies, therefore, the paper relies on an applied general equilibrium model to investigate the consequences of tax reform with heterogeneous households. The model simulations reveal several trade-offs between various objectives, such as cutting unemployment, stimulating the participation of secondary workers into the labor force, raising the quality and quantity of labor supply, and establishing an equitable income distribution. The paper also analyses how efficiency considerations affect the optimal progressiveness of labor income taxes. Finally, the optimal progression of the labor income tax is investigated in the presence of search unemployment, heterogeneous households and distributional concerns.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>OCFEB Research Memoranda;RM 0306</dc:relation><dc:title>Tax policy and labor market performance</dc:title><dc:type>Working Paper</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/1602/rm0306.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

per bucket in the Libor BGM model. We show that for some forms of the
volatility an approach based on re-calibration may lead to a large uncertainty
in estimated swap vega, as the instantaneous volatility structure may
be distorted by re-calibration. This does not happen in the case of constant
swap rate volatility. We then derive an alternative approach, not based on
re-calibration, by comparison with the swap market model. The strength of
the method is that it accurately estimates vegas for any volatility function
and at a low number of simulation paths. The key to the method is that
the perturbation in the Libor volatility is distributed in a clear, stable and
well understood fashion, whereas in the re-calibration method the change in
volatility is hidden and potentially unstable.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Econometric Institute Reports;EI 2003-33</dc:relation><dc:subject>central interest rate model</dc:subject><dc:subject>libor BGM model</dc:subject><dc:subject>risk management</dc:subject><dc:subject>swap market model</dc:subject><dc:subject>bermudan swaptions</dc:subject><dc:title>Risk managing bermudan swaptions in the libor BGM model</dc:title><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dc:subject>G13</dc:subject><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/1620/ei200333.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

In revenue management the capacities of the business and economy class sections of the plane are traditionally considered to be fixed and distinct capacities. In this paper, we give up this notion and instead consider the use of convertible seats. A row of these seats can be converted from business class seats to economy class seats and vice versa. This offers an airline company the possibility to adjust the capacity configuration of the plane to the demand pattern at hand. We show how to incorporate the shifting capacity opportunity into a dynamic, network-based revenue management model. We also extend the model to include cancellations and overbooking. With a small test case we show that incorporating the shifting capacity opportunity into the revenue management decision indeed provides a means to improve revenues.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Econometric Insitute Reports;EI 2003-46</dc:relation><dc:subject>revenue management</dc:subject><dc:subject>shifting capacity</dc:subject><dc:subject>seat inventory control</dc:subject><dc:subject>dynamic capacity management</dc:subject><dc:subject>convertible seats</dc:subject><dc:title>Airline revenue management with shifting capacity</dc:title><dc:type>Technical Report</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2093/ei2003446.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

We find that the model works well for investment grade credit default swaps, but only if we use swap or repo rates as proxy for default-free interest rates. This indicates that the government curve is no longer seen as the reference default-free curve.

The question is; what is so special about the gastric mucus that H. pylori can establish itself there? This mucus-layer, like all the mucus-layers in the body, is composed of mucins; large glycoproteins that are able form watery gels to protect the underlying epithelium. Several questions immediately arise, each of which we will try to answer in this thesis: 1. What is the nature of the gastric mucin? 2. What is the nature of the interaction between the bacterium and the mucin? 3. Can the expression of this gastric mucin sufficiently explain the gastric tropism towards the stomach? 4. Which mucins, or other secretory proteins, are produced in the metaplastic epithelia within the upper GI tract, and can this knowledge help us understand the underlying pathology and the role of H. pylori herein?
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Helicobacter pylori shows a characteristic tropism for the mucus-producing gastric epithelium. In infected patients, H. pylori colocalizes in situ with the gastric secretory mucin MUC5AC. The carbohydrate blood-group antigen Lewis B (LeB) was deemed responsible for the adherence of H. pylori to the gastric surface epithelium. We sought to determine if MUC5AC is the carrier of LeB, and thus if MUC5AC is the underlying gene product functioning as the main receptor for H. pylori in the stomach. METHODS: We studied three types of human tissue producing MUC5AC: Barrett's esophagus (BE), normal gastric tissue, and gastric metaplasia of the duodenum (GMD). Tissue sections were immuno-fluorescently stained for MUC5AC or LeB, and subsequently incubated with one of three strains of Texas red-labeled H. pylori, one of which was unable to bind to LeB. We determined the colocalization of MUC5AC or LeB with adherent H. pylori. RESULTS: The binding patterns for the two LeB-binding strains to all tissues were similar, whereas the strain unable to bind to LeB did not bind to any of the tissues. In normal gastric tissue, the LeB-binding strains always bound to MUC5AC- and LeB-positive epithelial cells. In four nonsecretor patients, colocalization of the LeB-binding strains was found to MUC5AC-positive gastric epithelial cells. In BE, the LeB-binding H. pylori strains colocalized very specifically to MUC5AC-positive cells. MUC5AC-producing cells in GMD contained LeB. Yet, LeB-binding H. pylori not only colocalized to MUC5AC or LeB present in GMD, but also bound to the LeB-positive brush border of normal duodenal epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Mucin MUC5AC is the most important carrier of the LeB carbohydrate structure in normal gastric tissue and forms the major receptor for H. pylori.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2003:055</dc:relation><dc:subject>Antigens</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tumor-Associated</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carbohydrate</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gastric Mucin</dc:subject><dc:subject>Helicobacter pylori</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lewis Blood-Group System</dc:subject><dc:title>Expression of Secretory Mucins in the Human Upper Gastrointestinal Tract; The Role of MUC5AC in the Adhesion of Helicobacter Pylori</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2192/Bovenkamp_cover.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2191/40.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2190/31.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2189/30.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2188/21.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2187/20.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2186/07.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2185/06.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2184/05.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2183/04.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2182/03.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2181/02.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2180/003.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2179/01.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2178/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2176/00.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

When left untreated, glaucoma results in visual field loss and eventually in blindness. In considering the diagnosis of glaucoma, the physician will evaluate the intraocular pressure, the optic nerve head and the visual field. This seems to be a straightforward diagnostic process, but, surprisingly, there is still no consensus on the criteria for the signs on which the diagnosis is based.
Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by death of retinal ganglion cells. The course of events that eventually leads to death of these cells is not exactly known, but the retinal nerve fiber layer, which is made up of the axons of the retinal ganglion cells, thins. Scanning laser polarimetry is an imaging technique that can detect glaucoma by assessing the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer.
Scanning laser polarimetry came onto the market in 1993. The working principle is based on the fact that in the nerve fiber layer a phase shift occurs in polarized laser light that is sent through the nerve fiber layer. This so called retardation is thought to be linearly correlated with nerve fiber layer thickness. In the past, scanning laser polarimetry has shown to discriminate well between normal and glaucomatous eyes.
The goal of this thesis was to investigate the clinical performance of the GDx (a revised version of the first scanning laser polarimeter, the Nerve Fiber Analyzer).
In summary, the GDx provides fast, objective and quantitative data on nerve fiber layer thickness. The applicability and reproducibility of measurements are high and the image acquisition is user and patient friendly. The GDx yields useful sensitivity and specificity values for the detection of glaucoma, whereas its role in follow-up remains to be investigated. As it stands, the GDx holds insufficient validity to serve as a single test for glaucoma. It does, however, provide a very useful addition to the existing tests we run in patients to make the correct diagnosis.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2003:031</dc:relation><dc:subject>Diagnostic Techniques</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ophthalmological</dc:subject><dc:subject>Glaucoma</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lasers</dc:subject><dc:title>Clinical Studies in Scanning Laser Polarimetry</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2214/Colen Dissertation.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2194/00.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>image/jpeg https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2215/Colen_front.jpg</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2197/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2198/003.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2199/01.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2200/02.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2201/03.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2202/04.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2203/05.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2204/06.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2205/07.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2206/08.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2207/09.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2208/20.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2209/21.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2210/30.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2211/40.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

In this paper, we introduce smooth transition models to study reference-based price response across 25 fast moving consumer good categories. Our application to 100 brands shows that 77% demonstrate reference-based price response, of which 36% reflects historical reference prices, 31% reflects competitive reference prices, and 33% reflects both types of reference prices. This reference-based price response shows asymmetry for gains versus losses on three levels: the threshold size, the sign and the magnitude of the elasticity difference. For historical reference prices, the threshold size is larger for gains (20%) than for losses (12%) and the assimilation/contrast effects for gains (-0.41) are smaller than the saturation effects for losses (0.81). For competitive reference prices, the threshold size is smaller for gains (3%) than for losses (16%), and the saturation effects are larger for gains (0.33) than for losses (0.15). These results are moderated by both brand and category characteristics that affect reference price accessibility and diagnosticity. Historical reference prices more often play a role for national brands, for planned purchases and in inexpensive categories with low price volatility and high purchase frequency. When price discounting, high-share brands face larger latitudes of acceptance. When raising prices, saturation effects set in later for brands with high price volatility and for categories with high price spread and for planned purchases. As for competitive reference prices, saturation effects set in later for expensive brands with high price volatility and in categories with lower price volatility, higher price spread and higher concentration. Sales, revenue and margin implications are illustrated for price changes typically observed in consumer markets.</dc:description><dc:description>Marketing literature has long recognized that price response need not be monotonic and symmetric, but has yet to provide generalizable market-level insights on reference price type, asymmetric thresholds and sign and magnitude of elasticity transitions. In this paper, we introduce smooth transition models to study reference-based price response across 25 fast moving consumer good categories. Our application to 100 brands shows that 77% demonstrate reference-based price response, of which 36% reflects historical reference prices, 31% reflects competitive reference prices, and 33% reflects both types of reference prices. This reference-based price response shows asymmetry for gains versus losses on three levels: the threshold size, the sign and the magnitude of the elasticity difference. For historical reference prices, the threshold size is larger for gains (20%) than for losses (12%) and the assimilation/contrast effects for gains (-0.41) are smaller than the saturation effects for losses (0.81). For competitive reference prices, the threshold size is smaller for gains (3%) than for losses (16%), and the saturation effects are larger for gains (0.33) than for losses (0.15). These results are moderated by both brand and category characteristics that affect reference price accessibility and diagnosticity. Historical reference prices more often play a role for national brands, for planned purchases and in inexpensive categories with low price volatility and high purchase frequency. When price discounting, high-share brands face larger latitudes of acceptance. When raising prices, saturation effects set in later for brands with high price volatility and for categories with high price spread and for planned purchases. As for competitive reference prices, saturation effects set in later for expensive brands with high price volatility and in categories with lower price volatility, higher price spread and higher concentration. Sales, revenue and margin implications are illustrated for price changes typically observed in consumer markets.</dc:description><dc:language>en_US</dc:language><dc:relation>ERS;ERS-2003-095-MKT</dc:relation><dc:relation>December 2003</dc:relation><dc:subject>kinked demand curve</dc:subject><dc:subject>smooth-transition regression models</dc:subject><dc:subject>competitive versus historical reference prices</dc:subject><dc:subject>asymmetric price thresholds</dc:subject><dc:subject>saturation versus assimilation/contrast effects</dc:subject><dc:subject>empirical generalizations</dc:subject><dc:subject>5001-6182;5410-5417.5;HF 5415.16</dc:subject><dc:title>Reference-based transitions in short-run price elasticity</dc:title><dc:type>Working Paper</dc:type><dc:subject>M;M 31;C 44;C 35</dc:subject><dc:subject>85 A;280 G;255 A;280 K</dc:subject><dc:subject>85.00;85.40;85.03</dc:subject><dc:subject>bedrijfskunde;bedrijfseconomie;marketing; besliskunde;prijsbeleid;elasticiteit (economie); econometrische modellen</dc:subject><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2212/ERS 2003 095 MKT.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

We specifically looked at the spatial characteristics of movement endpoints and the responses of the visuomotor system to altered relationships between visual and kinaesthetic information. In these studies we tried to determine what spatial information is incorporated in the motor commands generated by the visuomotor system and how this spatial information is represented. The tasks and experimental setup in the present studies were designed to study three-dimensional arm movements with the above-mentioned factors in mind.
The main aim of the present research was to reveal the nature of visuomotor coordination. However, the paradigm used also serves to assess the adaptability of the visuomotor system. This may have implications for ’real-life’ situations in which humans are confronted with discrepant sensory information. Discrepancies between what we feel and what we see are present in nearly all man-machine interactions, for instance, in teleoperation. Depending on the circumstances and the task at hand this may impose major demands on the operator and may lead to serious accidents. Endoscopic surgery is seen as complicated and difficult to learn. Knowledge about the way the visuomotor system is organised and the processes by which adaptation occurs may help to identify the crucial difficulties encountered when using complex tools and contribute to the development of appropriate training programs.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2003:022</dc:relation><dc:subject>Adaptation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arm</dc:subject><dc:subject>Physiological</dc:subject><dc:subject>Feedback</dc:subject><dc:subject>Kinesthesis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Orientation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Proprioception</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vision</dc:subject><dc:title>The Ability to Align Vision and Kinaesthesia</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>image/jpeg https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2233/Dobbelsteen_front.jpg</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2232/Dobbelsteen Dissertation.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2231/31.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2230/30.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2229/22.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2228/21.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2227/20.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2226/05.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2225/04.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2224/03.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2223/02.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2222/01.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2221/003.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2220/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2218/00.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

In particular, several studies have argued that the job insecurity of the (higher) middle class has substantially risen in the eighties and nineties. In this article the question whether or not this is true is investigated. The effect of job insecurity on union membership is also looked at. To answer the research questions we use survey data of 1992, 1994, and 1996. We only use data about workers in paid employment working at least 11 hours a week. The job insecurity of the workers is measured with three indicators: 1) actual unemployment; 2) perceived job insecurity; 3) numerical flexibility.
According to these indicators job security in the Netherlands is still
substantially high. However, especially the perceived insecurity and the
numerical flexibility have slightly risen in the 1992-1996 period. Contrary to our expectations, job security of the higher middle class is still relatively high compared to the working class. However, our data also show that the job (in)security of the lower middle class seems to be converging with the working class.
Our findings show that job insecurity has only minor – and mostly
statistically insignificant - effects on union membership. Moreover,
numerically flexible workers less often join a union than workers with a
more secure labour contract. However, it is important to note that with
respect to union membership members of the middle class – contrary to
expectations put forward in the literature –do not react differently on job insecurity than members of the working class.</dc:description><dc:language>other</dc:language><dc:relation>BSK-CPM;BSK-CPM-2000-005</dc:relation><dc:subject>security</dc:subject><dc:subject>employment</dc:subject><dc:subject>workers</dc:subject><dc:subject>unions</dc:subject><dc:subject>middle class</dc:subject><dc:title>Zullen door werkloosheid bedreigde leden van de middenklasse toetreden tot een vakbond?

To what extent students occupy jobs for which the low-educated umployed also qualify is subject of this study. By means of three separate empirical studies among: a) students in higher education, b) the low-educated unemployed and c) employers this question was evaluated. Occupation of jobs suitable for the low-educated unemployed by students is substantial and takes place especially in sectors such as: retail trade/shops, hotel and catering and industry. Motives of employers for recruting students in stead of low-educated persons refer in particular to their perceived communication skills, flexibility and their by comparison less need for settle in work time.</dc:description><dc:language>other</dc:language><dc:relation>BSK-CPM;BSK-CPM-1999-002</dc:relation><dc:subject>displacement</dc:subject><dc:subject>labor market</dc:subject><dc:subject>students</dc:subject><dc:title>Zijn lager opgeleiden de dupe van de toestroom van studenten op de arbeidsmarkt?

Twee
aspecten daarvan zijn onderzocht: de beroepsstatus en de kans op
werkloosheid. Op basis van de familie-enquête 2000 worden twee centrale
hypothesen getoetst met betrekking tot de mogelijk negatieve
langetermijneffecten van het hebben van een flexibele baan. De eerste, de
wachtkamerhypothese, stelt dat de negatieve gevolgen van een flexibele baan
slechts tijdelijk zijn, omdat deze een opstap vormt voor een vaste baan. De
tweede hypothese, de segmentatiehypothese, stelt dat het hebben van een
flexibele baan een blijvend negatief effect heeft. De analyse van de
beroepsstatus in dit artikel geeft steun aan de segmentatiehypothese. De
analyse van de kans op werkloosheid daarentegen weerspreekt beide
hypothesen. De veronderstelling dat de negatieve langetermijneffecten van
flexibele arbeid voor zwakke groepen op de arbeidsmarkt extra negatief
uitpakken, wordt slechts – wat betreft de beroepsstatus – voor jongeren
bevestigd.</dc:description><dc:language>other</dc:language><dc:relation>SOC;SOC-2003-009</dc:relation><dc:subject>employment</dc:subject><dc:subject>flexibility</dc:subject><dc:subject>occupational status</dc:subject><dc:subject>unemployment</dc:subject><dc:title>Loopbaaneffecten van flexibele arbeid</dc:title><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2242/BSK091.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Dat is een van de redenen geweest waarom de oorlog zo lang werd voortgezet toen hij in 1943 al definitief was verloren. In dit artikel wordt de vraag behandeld waarom ook na de oorlog in de Duitse militaire geschiedschrijving de visie op de gebeurtenissen vaak niet voldoende realistisch geweest is. In de jaren tachtig lijkt daar een kentering ingekomen, maar na de eenwording is er toch weer sprake van zekere gewenste bijstellingen van de herinnering aan de oorlog.</dc:description><dc:language>other</dc:language><dc:publisher>Tijdschrift voor Militaire Bedrijfskunde</dc:publisher><dc:subject>historisch besef</dc:subject><dc:subject>Tweede Wereldoorlog</dc:subject><dc:subject>militaire geschiedschrijving</dc:subject><dc:title>De Laatste Oorlogsjaren</dc:title><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2248/Schulten3.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

His research interests include the study of the impact of HRM on organisational performance and employee well-being, the transformation of work and employment relations in the service sector, and the nature and consequences of employee empowerment, partnership and participation in contemporary organisations. He is particularly interested in multilevel analysis and in the study of macro-micro-macro relationships in OB and HRM. Within this perspective, together with colleagues from King’s, Birkbeck College and the London School of Economics he has recently completed a series of studies on the impact of gender similarity/diversity on employee satisfaction and commitment at work, on the antecedents and consequences of information disclosure in Britain, and on the evaluation of the impact of the role of nurse consultants in the UK National Health Service. He publishes widely in internationally oriented journals such as the Journal of Management Studies, the British Journal of Industrial Relations, Work, Employment and Society, and The International Journal of Human Resource Management.</dc:description><dc:description>The analysis of the impact of human resource (HR) practices on employee well-being at work is an important yet relatively neglected area of inquiry within the field of human resource management (HRM). In this inaugural address, the main findings from ongoing research based on data from the 1998 British Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS98) are presented. These suggest that the HR practices that are adopted by organisations have a significant impact on the well-being of their workforces and that this impact tends, on the whole, to be more positive than negative. The effects, however, are more complex than is normally assumed in the literature. In particular, preliminary results indicate that the constellation of HR practices that help to maximise employee well-being (i.e. that make for happy workplaces), are not necessarily the same as those that make up the type of ‘High Performance Work Systems’ commonly identified in the literature. This has important theoretical, policy and ethical implications for the field of HRM. These are discussed along with important directions for future research.</dc:description><dc:description>Erasmus University Rotterdam.

This is certainly applicable to scaffolders, the study population in this thesis. Although many research efforts have been undertaken, relationships between various work-related risk factors and different stages of musculoskeletal disorders still remain unclear.
A theoretical model serves as a framework for studying the dynamic character of complaints over time and the impact of workrelated risk factors on the occurrence of low back pain. The consequences of low back pain complaints in terms of sickness absence and disability are studied in order to identify intervention strategies for successfully enhanced return to work.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2003:084</dc:relation><dc:subject>Disability Evaluation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Low Back Pain</dc:subject><dc:subject>Musculoskeletal Diseases</dc:subject><dc:subject>Occupational Diseases</dc:subject><dc:subject>Risk Factors</dc:subject><dc:title>Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders in Scaffolders</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>image/jpeg https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2275/Elders_front.jpg</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2272/32.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2271/31.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2270/30.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2269/21.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2268/20.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2267/09.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2266/08.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2265/07.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2264/06.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2263/05.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2262/04.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2261/03.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2260/01.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2259/02.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2258/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2256/00.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

These viruses are characterized by (B-cell) lymphotropism, their ability to establish latent infection in host cells and to induce proliferation of these latently infected cells. Approximately 90% of humans will become infected with EBV, generally without clinical evidence of disease. Primary infection usually occurs asymptomatically in childhood and results in a lifetime carrier state with periodic release of infectious virus into saliva which may cause infection of naive individuals. E.g. during adolescence, the latter type of infection may be referred to as kissing disease or Pfeiffer’s disease. EBV causes various benign syndromes, such as infectious mononucleosis, chronic active EBV infection, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease and oral hairy leukoplakia. EBV has also been associated with malignant diseases including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). PTLD refer to a range of hyperplastic to neoplastic lymphoid proliferations which occur after solid organ- or bone marrow transplantation, they mostly are of B-cell origin, and commonly (90%) contain EBV. 
The lack of early and accurate markers of EBV reactivation and disease has long hampered a timely diagnosis of post-transplant EBV lymphoproliferative disease. The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, however, has allowed for sensitive and quantitative monitoring of viral DNA in peripheral blood samples. This thesis has addressed the question whether molecular monitoring of EBV-DNA would accurately predict for EBV-LPD and whether preventive and therapeutic strategies could be developed based on viral load monitoring.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2003:007</dc:relation><dc:subject>Epstein-Barr Virus Infections</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hematologic Neoplasms</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Lymphoproliferative Disorders</dc:subject><dc:title>Epstein-Barr Virus Lymphoproliferative Disease following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: Prediction and early Prevention</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>image/jpeg https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2297/Esser_front.jpg</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2296/Esser Dissertation.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2295/31.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2294/30.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2292/21.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2291/20.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2290/07.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2289/06.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2288/05.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2287/04.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2286/03.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2285/02.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2284/01.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2283/004.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2282/003.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2281/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2280/00.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Hypermobility of stiffnes of the joint was determined by Doppler imaging of vibrations and by radiographic stress measurement. With neither method a sharp distinction between hypermobility and non-hypermobility of the joint could be made. Comparison of the Hohmann surgical procedure with the Lapidus procedure showed no difference in clinical results at short term follow up. Hence the significance of hypermobility of the first tarsometatarsal joint and the type of surgical correction of it remain subject of future research.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2003:029</dc:relation><dc:subject>Biomechanics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Joint Instability</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hallux Valgus</dc:subject><dc:subject>Range of Motion</dc:subject><dc:subject>Articular</dc:subject><dc:title>Hallux Valgus and the First Tarsometatarsal Joint: Clinical and Biomechanical Aspects</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>image/jpeg https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2324/Faber_front.jpg</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2322/Faber Dissertation.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The results are based on the Rotterdam Study, a large population based cohort study among 7,983 persons aged 55 years or older. A total of 7,721 persons were free from previous stroke. The cohort was followed for morbidity, including stroke. The incidence rate increased with age and was higher in men than in women over the entire age range. We found that an increased wall thickness did not only increase the risk of stroke, but also the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and lacunar infarction, irrespective of cardiovascular risk factors. The relevance of carotid plaques in persons without a previous stroke or TIA was not yet clear. Estradiol was not related to the risk of stroke, neither in men nor in women. Our results are in line with recent clinical trials that failed to report a beneficial effect from estrogen replacement therapy on the risk of stroke. A decreased testosterone level was related to an increased risk of stroke in men, in particular in those who did not smoke. We report that there is no clear relation between the Dallele in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and risk of stroke. The relation between mutations in the hemochromatosis gene and stroke: two mutations (C282 and H63D) were related to the risk of stroke and increased carotid intima-media thickness in persons who smoked or had hypertension.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2003:011</dc:relation><dc:subject>Arteriosclerosis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cerebral Infarction</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Sex Hormones</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vital Statistics</dc:subject><dc:title>The Role of Atherosclerosis, Hormones and Genes in Stroke</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>image/jpeg https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2341/Hollander_front.jpg</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2340/Hollander Dissertation.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2339/40.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2338/31.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2337/30.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2336/21.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2335/20.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2334/06.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2333/05.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2332/03.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2331/04.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2330/02.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2329/01.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2328/003.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2327/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2325/00.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

They may take a strategy not only of exploitation, to leverage existing assets, competencies and products, built up in their home countries, but also, and perhaps even primarily, of exploration, to profit from diversity of host countries to develop new products and competencies.

They may take a strategy not only of exploitation, to leverage existing assets, competencies and products, built up in their home countries, but also, and perhaps even primarily, of exploration, to profit from diversity of host countries to develop new products and competencies.

The three main questions in this thesis were: (1) How do recently diagnosed patients and their partners perceive the risk of wheelchair dependence? (2) How do perceptions of risk relate to psychological well-being? (3) What are the determinants of perception of prognostic risk? Before answering these key questions, the psychological burden of disease and the quality of life (QoL) of patients and partners in the early phase of MS are examined.
It was demonstrated that the early period after diagnosis of MS puts a substantial emotional burden on patients and their partners. Patients and partners overestimated the short- and medium-term risks of wheelchair dependence, but underestimated the lifetime risk. Moreover, higher perceptions of the short- and medium risks were found among patients with higher symptom perception, and were associated with poorer psychological well-being. These findings are interpreted from a psychological and clinical perspective.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2003:042</dc:relation><dc:subject>Disability Evaluation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Emotions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Life Change Events</dc:subject><dc:subject>Multiple Sclerosis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Quality of Life</dc:subject><dc:title>Perception of Prognostic Risk in Multiple Sclerosis.</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2358/00.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2362/003.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2363/02.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2367/06.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2368/07.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2369/08.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2370/09.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2371/10.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2372/11.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2373/12.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2374/13.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2375/20.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2376/21.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2377/30.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>image/jpeg https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2378/Janssens_front.jpg</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2360/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2361/01.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2366/05.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2364/03.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2365/04.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Soon after the discovery of the CYP21 gene and the nearby CYP21P pseudogene, a picture emerged of great variability in the arrangement of these genes on chromosome 6p21.31. Some of these variants constitute genetic defects that cause steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 
The study's initial objective was therefore to obtain an image of that variability by charting the layout of the genetic environment of the CYP21 gene in steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency patients and in the general population. Two genetic mechanisms that are fundamental to the evolution of the genome, and especially the MHC, are also instrumental in generating the variability in this region:
- simultaneous deletion and duplication of genes by unequal crossover, and:
- non-reciprocal sequence transfer between genes by gene conversion.
A major point of attention in this thesis is how these mechanisms create alleles that carry steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
For genetic analysis of CYP21 defects, it is often assumed that a chromosome either carries a CYP21 gene, or has a CYP21 deletion. Chapter 7 demonstrates that this assumption is not without risk: chromosomes with two CYP21 genes in tandem are found in the general population at a frequency equal to or higher than steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency alleles. Since one of the two CYP21 genes is defective on such chromosomes, PCR-based mutation analysis without haplotyping can lead to erroneous assignment of carrier status.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2002:048</dc:relation><dc:subject>Adrenal Hyperplasia</dc:subject><dc:subject>Congenital</dc:subject><dc:subject>DNA Mutational Analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Genes</dc:subject><dc:subject>Steroid 21-Hydroxylas</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vital Statistics</dc:subject><dc:title>Molecular genetics and epidemiology of steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

We argue that managerial capabilities and organizing principles for innovation should have a higher priority on the Dutch Innovation Agenda. Managerial capabilities for innovation deal with cognitive elements such as the capacity to absorb knowledge, create entrepreneurial mindsets, and facilitate managerial experimentation and higher-order learning abilities. These capacities can only be developed by distinctive managerial roles that enhance hierarchy, teaming and shared norms. Utilizing these unique managerial capabilities requires novel organizing principles, such as managing internal rates of change, nurturing self-organization and balancing high levels of exploration and exploitation. These managerial capabilities and organizing principles of innovation create new sources of productivity growth and competitive advantage.

The dramatic fall back of the Netherlands in the league of innovative and high productivity countries of the World Economic Forum-Report can be mainly attributed to the present lack in the Netherlands of these key managerial and organizational enablers of innovation and productivity growth. We provide various levers for building unique managerial capabilities and novel organizing principles of innovation. Moreover, we describe the necessary roles that different actors have to play in this innovation arena. In particular, we focus on the often neglected but important role of strategic regulations that speed up innovation and productivity growth. They are the least expensive way to boost innovation in organizations in both the Dutch private and public sector. 

Finally, we discuss the implications for the Dutch Innovation Agenda. It should start with setting a challenging ambition, namely the return of The Netherlands within the WEF- league of the top-ten most innovative and productive countries of the world. Considering the under-utilization of available knowledge stemming from technological innovations, managerial and organizational determinants of innovation should receive first priority. These determinants have a high strategic relevance and should receive more public recognition. We suggest to organize an annual innovation ranking of the most outstanding Dutch firms, to develop an innovation audit that measures firms’ non-technological innovation capacity, and to create an overall innovation policy for fast diffusion of new managerial capabilities and adequate organizing principles throughout the Dutch private and public sector.
In conclusion, we add five new items to the Dutch Innovation Agenda:

1.	Prioritize administrative innovations
Investments in management and organization determinants of absorption of knowledge and its successful application (administrative innovation) should have a higher priority than investments in technological innovations.
2.	Build new managerial capabilities and develop novel organizing principles
For these administrative innovations to succeed, firms have to build managerial capabilities (broad knowledge-base, absorptive capacity, managerial experimentation, higher-order learning) and various management roles (hierarchy, teaming, shared norms) to increase the assimilation of external knowledge and the utilization for innovation. Moreover, they have to develop novel organizing principles that increase internal rates of change, nurture self-organization and synchronize high levels of exploration and exploitation.
3.	Set levers of innovation by creating selection environments that favor innovation and by redefining the roles of key actors 
Management has to create a proper organizational context to foster entrepreneurship and innovation (internal selection environment). Governmental agencies have to focus on innovation and productivity enabling strategic regulations (external selection environment). Moreover, research institutes, business schools, and consulting firms should not only focus on technological knowledge, but also on managerial and organizational knowledge for innovation. In the end, private small and large firms and public institutions have to recognize that they all must contribute to the national goal of increasing innovation and productivity growth.
4.	Create a new challenging national ambition: return of the Netherlands within the top-10
The Netherlands has to return to the top-ten most innovative and productive countries in the world as reflected in international rankings such as the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index.
5.	Proliferate an awareness and passion for innovation:
Create public awareness and recognition of the societal relevance of outstanding managerial capabilities and organizing principles to innovation and productivity growth:
o	Initiate a Dutch innovation ranking in terms of management and organization;
o	Develop proper assessment tools for innovations in management and organization;
o	Enhance reporting on the progress on managerial and organizational innovation as part of modern corporate governance and as part of outstanding annual reports.

These issues may contribute to rethinking the fundamental sources of innovation, productivity growth and sustainable competitive advantage of the Dutch economy.</dc:description><dc:description>In this essay, we challenge the present dominant emphasis in the Dutch Innovation Debate on the creation of technological innovations, the focus on a few core technologies, and the allocation of more financial resources.

Today an increasing flow of products is going back in the chain. Thus, companies have to manage reverse logistics as well.This thesis contributes to a better understanding of reverse logistics. The thesis brings insights on reverse logistics decision-making and it lays down theoretical principles for reverse logistics as a research field.In particular it puts together a framework for reverse logistics identifying the elementary dimensions, providing typologies, and structuring their interrelations.With respect to aiding decision-making, this thesis comprises return handling and inventory management. On the first, the focus is on critical factors for the combination vs. separation of reverse and forward flows during material handling. On the second, the main research issue is the value of information. One of the findings is that more informed methods do not necessarily lead to the best performance.Furthermore, this thesis proposes a reflection on the future development of the field.  Through a Delphi study with an international panel of academics working on the area, recommendations are made concerning both research and pedagogy. This thesis also poses the following question: is it a matter of simply managing reverse logistics or of reversing logistics management?The message is: logistics cannot go forward without reverse thinking!</dc:description><dc:description>Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM), Promoteres: Prof.dr.ir.

In dit proefschrift wordt een dergelijk raamwerk ontwikkeld, op basis van inzichten uit de bestaande literatuur. Centraal in het raamwerk is een onderscheid tussen de ‘governance’ en de structuur van de cluster. Er worden vier structuur gerelateerde variabelen geidentificeerd: agglomeratie voor- en nadelen, interne concurrentie, hetereogeniteit van bedrijven in de cluster en cluster drempels. Er worden ook vier governance-gerelateerde variabelen onderscheiden: vertrouwen, intermediairs, ‘leader firms’ en collectieve actie regimes.In het empirisch onderzoek, drie cases van de havenclusters in Rotterdam, Durban en de Beneden-Mississippi, wordt de relevantie van deze variabelen gevalideerd. Het belang van de variabelen, de sterktes en zwaktes van de drie havenclusters en kansen voor beleid en management in de havenclusters worden besproken.De onderzoeksresultaten zijn relevant voor onderzoekers gespecialiseerd in clusters en voor onderzoekers die zich met havens bezighouden.

Even though cluster studies are numerous, a coherent framework to analyze cluster performance is lacking. In this thesis, such a framework is developed, drawing from different schools that deal with clusters. Central in the framework is a distinction to variables of cluster performance related to the structure of a cluster and variables related to the governance of a cluster. Four structure variables - agglomeration ands disagglomeration forces, internal competition, heterogeneity of the cluster and the level of entry and exit barriers - and four governance related variables - the presence of trust, the presence of intermediaries, the presence of leader firms and the quality of collective action regimes - are identified and discussed. The validity of these variables is confirmed in the three case studies, of the port clusters of Rotterdam, Durban, and the lower Mississippi. The strengths and weaknesses of the three port clusters, the importance of the variables discussed above and opportunities for policy and management to improve the performance of clusters are discussed.The results of this study are relevant for cluster scholars and for scholars specializing in port studies. The thesis is also relevant for (port) cluster managers and for managers of firms in (port) clusters, since implications of this study for policy and management in (port) clusters are discussed.</dc:description><dc:description>Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM).

It is a tetrameric protein composed of two α-globin chains and two β-globin chains. These chains are encoded by the α- and β-globin gene loci. The globin loci are located on separate chromosomes and are composed of several developmentally regulated genes and regulatory elements located both upstream of the gene loci and around the individual genes. Lesions in the globin clusters give rise to blood disorders known as hemoglobinopathies. The study of the molecular basis of these disorders led to the identification of many regulatory elements of the globin loci, including the locus control region (LCR). The β-globin locus is one of the best-studied multi gene loci and has been extensively used as a model system for the study of gene regulation. The aims of this thesis are to study the mechanism of transcriptional activation of the globin loci, the role of the hypersensitive sites in LCR function and the further characterisation of putative γ-globin regulatory elements. 
In conclusion, the studies presented here show:

In the late stages of ARM, called age-related macular degeneration (AMD), photoreceptor cells gradually disappear. New vessels growing beneath the retina may complicateb the disease; this is called âwetâ or neovascular AMD. Knowledge about causes and pathogenesis of this eye disease could lead to therapies, and probably even more important, to strategies that prevent the disease from occurring. The purpose of this thesis was to study several of many molecular changes that occur during the development of ARM.
Growth factors play a role in choroidal neovascularization. With advancing age, the thickness of the retina decreases. Little is known about the way cells disappear during this process. Apoptosis was studied in the macula of rhesus monkeys of different ages. The findings indicate that apoptosis in the primate macula occurs at all ages at similar rate, possibly increasing in the oldest age group, and may account for the decreasing thickness of the primate macula with age. It appears to be unlikely that Fas-ligand (FasL) expressed on retinal pigment epithelium controls the extension of choroidal neovascularization. Several growth factors could be involved in the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD. The results may point towards a role of the Insulinlike Growth Factors in the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD.
Somatostatin reduces newly formed vessels by inhibiting the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor axis and also has a direct anti-proliferative effect on various cell types involved in angiogenesis. It is demonstrated that most early-formed choroidal neovascularization in eyes of patients with AMD express sst2A, which is a receptor for somatostatin. The sst2A receptor binds potential anti-angiogenic somatostatin-analogues like octreotide. Therefore, somatostatin analogues may be an effective therapy in early stages of neovascular AMD.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2002:061</dc:relation><dc:subject>Choroidal Neovascularization</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gene Expression</dc:subject><dc:subject>Insulin-Like Growth Factor I</dc:subject><dc:subject>Macular Degeneration</dc:subject><dc:subject>Somatostatin</dc:subject><dc:title>Development of age-related maculopathy: a histochemical and molecular approach</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2439/03.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2453/Lambooij Dissertation.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2441/04.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>image/gif https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2454/Lambooij_front.gif</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2442/05.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2432/00.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2443/06.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2434/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2435/003.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2444/07.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2436/004.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2437/01.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2445/08.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2438/02.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2446/09.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2447/10.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2448/20.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2449/21.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2450/22.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2451/30.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2452/31.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

In 1997, approximately 8,500 new cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed in the Netherlands and more than 4,000 individuals died from this disease. Screening for colorectal cancer in the general population has the potential to save lives. Potential screening tests are the fecal occult blood test (FOBT), colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. FOBT tests detect blood in stool from bleeding asymptomatic colorectal cancer or large adenomas. Sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are both endoscopic tests that visualize the colorectal tract. If adenomas, precursors of cancer, are detected at the screening test, they can be removed immediately.
It is recommended that patients with removed adenomas undergo regular colonoscopic surveillance. In this thesis, aspects of colorectal cancer screening and of colonoscopic surveillance (follow-up) of adenoma patients are studied by analysis of relevant data and with the use of the MISCAN-COLON model. This is a micro-simulation model that simulates a large number of fictitious individual life histories. The three main uses of the model are analysis of data of population studies in the field of screening and surveillance of adenoma patients, testing of hypotheses about the natural history of adenomas and colorectal cancer, and evaluation of screening policies.
General conclusions The MISCAN-COLON model is a useful tool for the analysis of screening and surveillance studies and for the evaluation of screening strategies. A wide variation is seen among the different models regarding the assumptions on the adenoma dwell time and the percentage of colorectal cancers that originate from adenomas. Screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood tests reduces colorectal cancer mortality and is cost-effective.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2003:087</dc:relation><dc:subject>Colorectal Neoplasms</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Simulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cost-Benefit Analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mass Screening</dc:subject><dc:subject>Occult Blood</dc:subject><dc:title>Effects and Costs of Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-up after Polypectomy</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2467/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2456/00.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2469/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2470/003.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2471/01.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2472/02.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2473/03.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2474/04.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2475/05.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2477/06.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2478/07.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2479/08.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2480/09.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2481/20.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2482/21.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2483/30.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2484/Loeve Dissertation.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>image/jpeg https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2485/Loeve_front.jpg</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

met water. En veel van de fouten worden ook nu nog gemaakt. Door onvoldoende rekening te houden met ecologische
natuurwetten loopt de mensheid het risico in de volgende eeuw geconfronteerd te worden met overstromingen en droogtes,
water- en voedseltekorten en uit de hand lopende conflicten over water. Daarbij kunnen aantallen slachtoffers vallen die het
voorstellingsvermogen te boven gaan. Om het tij te keren is een fundamenteel andere omgang met water nodig. We moeten onze
watersystemen niet langer beschouwen als last of als goedkoop produktiemiddel, maar veel meer als ‘eco-fabrieken’ waar
producten en diensten worden geproduceerd waar de maatschappij behoefte aan heeft. Daarbij moeten we de uitgestoken hand
van Moeder Natuur niet langer afwijzen, maar juist dankbaar aanvaarden. Dus geen strijd tegen het water, maar meekoppelen
met de natuur. De waterbeheerders van de volgende eeuw zullen pragmatisch moeten omgaan met ecologische natuurwetten, en
gebruik maken van de stuurbare mogelijkheden die ecosystemen bieden. Dit keer gaat het niet over mogen en moeten, maar
over durven en doen.</dc:description><dc:language>other</dc:language><dc:relation>ESM;ESM-1999-002</dc:relation><dc:subject>water supply</dc:subject><dc:subject>management</dc:subject><dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject><dc:title>Eco-pragmatisme: Omgaan met rivieren, delta’s, kust en zee in de 21e eeuw</dc:title><dc:type>Preprint</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2460/ESM015.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Zoetwater op aarde blijkt een in toenemende mate schaarse en onvervangbare grondstof te zijn, en van nature ongelijk verdeeld. Menselijk ingrijpen in grote riviersystemen (dammen, stuwen) en sectorale en lokale afwegingsmechanismen hebben deze ongelijkheid verder vergroot. De auteurs illustreren dit met voorbeelden van de Amazone, de Eufraat en de Tigris, de Aralzee en het Rijnstroomgebied. Een explosieve toename van de wereldbevolking en een sterke urbanisatie zullen de problemen verder verscherpen. Het nieuwe fenomeen van "eco-vluchtelingen" 'wordt beschreven. De auteurs verwachten dat, zonder een integrale stroomgebiedsbenadering, de olie-crississen van deze eeuw zullen verbleken bij de water-crisissen in de 21ste eeuw. Voor Nederland komen de auteurs tot de conclusie, dat Nederland voor zijn zoetwater voorziening vrijwel volledig afhankelijk is van het buitenland en zich daarmee in een uiterst kwetsbare positie bevindt.</dc:description><dc:language>other</dc:language><dc:relation>ESM;ESM-1995-001</dc:relation><dc:subject>water supply</dc:subject><dc:subject>natural resources</dc:subject><dc:subject>scarcity</dc:subject><dc:title>Dorstige aarde.

To date, however, limitations in patients with CRPS1 of an upper limb have not been objectively measured.Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an upper limb-activity monitor (ULAM), and to determine the applicability of the ULAM. Because the ULAM is relatively new and its measurement technique clearly differs from what is commonly used in research and clinic with respect to several methodological and practical criteria, we studied how the ULAM outcome measures were related to four questionnaires that also aim to assess the functional consequences of diseases.
It was concluded that the current ULAM has the potential to validly assess upper limb activity over time in upper limb CRPSI.

 In ten female chronic CRPS1 patients and ten healthy control subjects, 24-h activity patterns were measured with the ULAM. This ULAM consists of body-fixed acceleration sensors, connected to a recorder worn around the waist. The ULAM automatically detects upper limb activity during mobility-related activities. Several outcome measures related to general mobility and upper limb usage were compared between patients and controls. The results showed that CRPSI in the dominant upper limb had modest impact on general mobility; i.e. on the percentages spent in body positions and body motions and on mean intensity of body activity. For upper limb usage outcome measures during sitting, there was a marked difference between CRPS1 patients and controls. Especially patients with dominant side involvement clearly showed less activity of their involved limb during sitting, indicated by significant differences for the mean intensity (P=0.014), percentage (P=0.004), and proportion (P=0.032) of upper limb activity. It is concluded that these ten chronic CRPS1 patients still had limitations in upper limb usage during everyday life, 3.7 years (average) after the causative event.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2003:107</dc:relation><dc:subject>Activities of Daily Living</dc:subject><dc:subject>Monitoring</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ambulatory</dc:subject><dc:subject>Arm</dc:subject><dc:subject>Disability Evaluation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Motor Activity</dc:subject><dc:subject>Posture</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy</dc:subject><dc:title>Objective Measurement of Activity Limitations in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type I; Development and Application of an Upper Limb-Activity Monitor</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2512/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2514/01.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2515/02.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2516/03.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2517/04.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2518/05.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2519/06.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2520/07.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2521/08.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2510/00.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2522/09.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2523/10.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2524/20.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2525/21.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2526/30.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2527/31.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2528/Schasfoort Dissertation.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>image/jpeg https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2529/Schasfoort_front.jpg</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

This includes the important question: Can patient-specific recommendations be made with regard to the preferred valve substitute for patients requiring aortic valve replacement, based on the methodology described in this thesis? This question will be discussed by: (1) Commenting on the current clinical evidence on outcome after aortic root replacement with autografts and allografts, (2) Critically evaluating the methods of meta-analysis and microsimulation with regard to their ability to predict outcome after aortic valve replacement, (3) Comparing calculated outcome after autograft versus allograft aortic root replacement, and versus other valve substitutes, and finally to actual situations.
In conclusion, clinical experience with autograft and allograft aortic root replacement turned out to be limited, both with regard to number of patients and duration of follow-up. Meta-analysis and microsimulation provide an objective and flexible tool to overcome these limitations and allow calculations of long-term prognosis after autograft and allograft aortic root replacement based on current limited evidence. Using this methodology, detailed information can be obtained on the determinants of prognosis, providing improved insight into outcome after autograft and allograft aortic root replacement. However, both meta-analysis and microsimulation have their limitations and the output of the microsimulation model strongly depends on the quality of the input and the assumptions of the model. Continuous refinement and updating of the microsimulation model are therefore necessary to provide objective and valid estimates of outcome after aortic valve replacement in the future. Furthermore, education of clinicians on the methodology of microsimulation is essential for successful application in clinical practice. An internet application of the model should become available in the near future for easy access use by clinicians.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2002:034</dc:relation><dc:subject>Aortic Valve</dc:subject><dc:subject>Bioprosthesis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Computer Simulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>Evidence-Based Medicine</dc:subject><dc:subject>Meta-Analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transplantation, Autologous</dc:subject><dc:subject>Transplantation, Homologous</dc:subject><dc:title>Prognosis after Autograft and Allograft Aortic Root Replacement.

Our studies showed that it was possible to label the liver glycogen with naturally 13C-enriched carbohydrate and to monitor its oxidation. 13C-enriched muscle glycogen did not interfere with the test within the test conditions. The test design and the tests results were confirmed by using the inverse test set-up in persons who were used to a habitual diet of 13C-enriched carbohydrates. The test was reasonably reproducible within the same persons, though the study group was small. Extending the dietary 13C-enrichment from one to three days did alter the test results. These alterations were small and possibly of no clinical importance. A pilot study showed that the test indeed is capable of detecting differences in glycogen oxidation between cirrhotics and healthy individuals.
The clinical application of the test needs further validation by comparing it with other techniques such as the NMR. The studies described in this thesis demonstrate the feasibility of using naturally isotope enriched products for metabolic studies. This breath test is relatively simple to perform as a bedside test and makes use of inexpensive substrates. For a metabolic test to evaluate a complex process, it is reasonably reproducible.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Erasmus MC;Diss. 2003:039</dc:relation><dc:subject>Breath Tests</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carbon Dioxide</dc:subject><dc:subject>Carbon Isotope</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liver Glycogen</dc:subject><dc:subject>Oxidation-Reduction</dc:subject><dc:title>A 13CO2 Breath Test for Liver Glycogen Oxydation</dc:title><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:format>image/jpeg https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2558/Tanis_front.jpg</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2557/31.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2556/30.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2555/21.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2554/20.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2553/05.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2552/04.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2551/03.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2550/02.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2549/01.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2548/001.pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf https://ep.eur.nl/retrieve/2546/00.pdf</dc:format></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
