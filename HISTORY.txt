Changelog
=========
2.5.2 (unreleased)

2.5.1

-  Added customizable client retry policy (contributed by adimascio)

-  Added compatibility with Python 3.8 (contributed by krenzlin)

-  Do not resume ListRecord requests if no result was returned (contributed by wetneb)

2.5.0 (2017-07-03) 

-  Added Python 3 compatibility (contributed by Tobias Kurze, Uli Köhler
   and Michał Pasternak)
-  Travis support and badges (Michał Pasternak)

2.4.5 (2015-12-23) 

-  Added switch in client to force harvesting using HTTP Get method
   (contributed by Stefan Oderbolz).

-  Added unofficial GetMetadata verb in server and client. GetMetadata
   is identical to GetRecord, but only returns the first element below
   the oai:metadata element, it does not return the oai enveloppe.

2.4.4 (2010-09-30) 

-  Changed contact info, Migrated code from Subversion to Mercurial

2.4.3 (2010-08-19) 

-  Convert lxml.etree._ElementUnicodeResult and ElementStringResult to
   normal string and unicode objects, to prevent errors when these
   objects get pickled. (lp #617439)

2.4.2 (2010-05-03) 

-  OAI_DC and DC namespace declarations should not be declared on the
   document root, but on the child of the metadata element. According to
   the OAI spec

2.4.1 (2009-11-16) 

-  When specifying a date (not a datetime) for the until parameter,
   default to 23:59:59 instead of 00:00:00

2.4 (2009-05-04) 

-  Included support for description elements in OAI Identify headers,
   added ‘toolkit’ description by default.

2.3.1 (2009-04-24) 

-  Raise correct error when from and until parameters have different
   granularities

2.3 (2009-04-23) 

-  Fixed bug and added tests for handling invalid dateTime formats, the
   server will now respond with a BadArgument (XML) error instead of a
   python traceback.

-  Use buildout to create testrunner and environment as opposed to
   ``test.py`` script.

   Install buildout by:

   $ python bootstrap.py $ bin/buildout

   Run the tests by doing:

   $ bin/test

   To get a python interpreter with the ``oaipmh`` library importable::

   $ bin/devpython

2.2.1 (2008-04-04) 

-  Added xml declaration to server output
-  Prettyprint xml output
-  compatibility fix: should be compatible with lxml 2.0 now
-  server resumption tokens now work with POST requests.
-  Fix for client code that handles 503 response from server.

2.2 (2006-11-20) 

-  Support for BatchingServer. A BatchingServer implements the
   IBatchingOAI interface. This is very similar to IOAI, but methods get
   a ‘cursor’ and ‘batch_size’ argument. This can be used to efficiently
   implement batching OAI servers on top of relational databases.

-  Make it possible to explicitly pass None as the from or until
   parameters for a OAIPMH client.

-  an extra nsmap argument to Server and BatchingServer allows the
   programmer to specify either namespace prefix to namespace URI
   mappings that should be used in the server output.

-  fixed a bug where the output wasn’t encoded properly as UTF-8.

2.1.5 (2006-09-18) 

-  compatibility fix: it should work with lxml 1.1 now.

2.1.4 (2006-06-16) 

-  Distribute as an egg.

2.1.3 

-  Add infrastructure to deal with non-XML compliant OAI-PMH feeds; an
   XMLSyntaxError is raised in that case.

-  added tolerant_datestamp_to_datetime which is a bit more tolerant
   than the normal datestamp_to_datetime when encountering bad
   datestamps.

-  Split off datestamp handling into separate datestamp module.

2.0 

-  Add support for day-only granularity (YYYY-MM-DD) in client. calling
   ‘updateGranularity’ with the client will check with the server (using
   identify()) to see what granularity the server supports. If the
   server only supports day level granularity, the client will make sure
   only YYYY-MM-DD timestamps are sent.

2.0b1 

-  Added framework for implementing OAI-PMH compliant servers.

-  Changed package structure: now a oaipmh namespace package. Client
   functionality now in oaipmh.client.

-  Refactoring of oaipmh.py module to reuse code for both client and
   server.

-  Extended testing infrastructure.

-  Switched over from using libxml2 Python wrappers to the lxml binding.

-  Use generators instead of hacked up **getitem**. This means that the
   return from listRecords, listIdentifiers and listSets are now not
   normal lists but iterators. They can easily be turned into a normal
   list by using list() on them, however.

1.0.1 

-  Typo in oaipmh.py

1.0 

-  Added an encoding parameter to the serialize call, which fixes a
   unicode bug.

0.7.4 

-  A harvest can return records with <header status“deleted”> that
   contain no metadata and are merely an indication that that
   metadata-set for that resource is no longer on the OAI service. These
   records should be used to remove metadata from the catalog if it is
   there, bur should never be stored or catalogued themselves. They
   aren’t now. (Fixed in zope/OAICore/core.py)

0.7 

Initial public release.
